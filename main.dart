// A variable name is the name assigned to the memory location where the user stores the data and that data can be fetched when required with the help of the variable by calling its variable name. There are various types of variable that are used to store the data. The type which will be used to store data depends upon the type of data to be stored.

  // Rules for defining variables
  // 1. Variable name should start with alphabets or underscore
  // 2. Variable name can contain alphabets, numbers and underscore
  // 3. Variable name should not contain any spaces
  // 4. Variable name should not start with numbers
  // 5. Variable name should not be a reserved keyword
  // 6. Variable name should not be a number only

// Keywords in Dart
// Keywords are the set of reserved words which canâ€™t be used as a variable name or identifier because they are standard identifiers whose function are predefined in Dart.
